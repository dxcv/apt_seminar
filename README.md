# **apt_seminar**

This is a repository for all the stuff I did during the UZH seminar Applied Portfolio Theory, written in Python 3.6. If you are new to Python and want to avoid confusion/headaches, I highly recommend to follow theses steps:

1. Read https://protostar.space/why-you-need-python-environments-and-how-to-manage-them-with-conda. It will explain you why using the Python distirbutions Anaconda/Miniconda and consequently why conda environments for projects is super nice and efficient! It will show you how to download Anaconda en set up virtual environments. That's why I wont go into these steps in detail here.
2. Download Visual Studio Code (VSC) (https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Set up VSC for Python (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNFgRUD2w68) and for Git (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOwyH2-VCVY&t=63s) 
4. Open Anaconda Prompt and create a virtual environment with conda (see Step 1), e.g:
> `conda create --name apt python=3.6`
5. Activate environment: 
> `conda activate apt_sem`
6. Clone this repository (see step 3): 
7. Download all the required modules for this project: 
> `pip install --user --requirement requirements.txt`
